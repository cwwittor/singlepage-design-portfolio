## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

This project was a bit harder than the first few I had done, I think what I learned from this was how to import and use javascript in a barebones project, and that a lot of my solutions right now arent great due to only working at the assigned viewports. I need to get better at not making brittle designs.

### Continued development

- move away from brittle resizing.
- had gotten a little lazy with css variables.

### Useful resources

stack overflow, w3 schools. and for small reference stuff raycast
